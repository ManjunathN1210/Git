Version control system is a system that records to a file or a set of files over the time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Advantage of Version control system is that it allows you to revert back to a previous state, review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing the problem, who introduced an issue, when and where.

In simple if we screw up something with files, we can also recover it back.

Git is an open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is a Distributed Version Control System.

Git does not rely on a central server to store all version's of its project files. Instead every user clones a copy of the repository (collection of files) and has the full history of their project on their own hard drive.

A repository is referred to as a collection of files.

Following Steps are used while working with GIT :- 

Step 1:- git init :- It is used to initialize empty git repository.

Step 2:- git status :- It is used to check the status of the git state of the working directory.

Step 3:- git add <file_name> :- It is used to add the files into the git repository.

Step 4:- git commit -m "Message" :- It is used to identify the reason for the commit into repository.

// git adds the file in the create mode with a specific file permission. Here it refers to Normal File.
// Other options are :- 100755, 100644
Step 5:- git log :- It is used to get the log information of all the commits staged in the repository. It gives us the log information according to the recent commits made.

Step 6:- git restore --staged <file> :- It is used to restore a staged file that was added previously using git add.

Step 7:- git reset <hash_id> :- It is used to remove or unstage the commits that were performed.

Step 8:- git stash :- It is used to save the working directory which are staged but not required now to commit.
